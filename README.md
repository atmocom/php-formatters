# php-formatters
**wxloader.php** unifies the function of **acpwx.php** and **atmocsv.php** and replaces both scripts. 

The script fetches current and cumulative data from a data file that is generated by **atmolog.php**, hence you must begin with installing **atmolog.php** and verify that it works correctly. 

The fetched data is formatted and displayed as CSV, JSON or XML. This is equivalent to opening a file containing data formatted in one of these three formats.

The main purpose of this script is to provide a performance optimized data channel to various weather dashboards such as ***Weather34 Home Weather Station*** and ***Meteotemplate***.

## Simple installation
Upload **wxloader.php** to the same folder where you have installed the **atmolog.php** script. 

Latest weather data can now be accessed via the web browser by providing your Weather Underground station ID and a formatting parameter: 'c' for CSV, 'j' for JSON or 'x' for XML. For example:
```
CSV: http://www.mysite.com/wxloader.php?id=iplace17&fmt=c
JSON: http://www.mysite.com/wxloader.php?id=iplace17&fmt=j
XML: http://www.mysite.com/wxloader.php?id=iplace17&fmt=x
```

Data is refreshed every time ATMOCOM uploads new data to **atmolog.php**.

## Advanced installation: 
TBA

### Special Note
CSV fields and their order are specified at the end of the **wxloader.php** file in comments.
